			<h1>Deaths at Disneyland</h1>

				<p>This is a summary of deaths that have taken place at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Severe injuries are not included in this list. While the California Department of Safety and Health (CDSH) has ruled that some guest-related incidents are Disney's fault, the majority of incidents were due to negligence on the guests' part.</p>

				<p>The term incidents refers to major accidents, injuries, deaths, and similar significant occurrences. While these incidents are required to be reported to regulatory authorities for investigation, attraction-related incidents usually fall into one of the following categories:</p>

					<ul>Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to violate park rules.</ul>

					<ul>The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.</ul>

					<ul>Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance.</ul>

					<ul>Act of God or a generic accident (e.g. slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action by any party.</ul>


				<p>In 1985, Time magazine reported that nearly 100 lawsuits are filed against Disney each year for numerous incidents.</p>
